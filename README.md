*DESCRIPTION* : THIS PROJECT IS A BEGINNER-FRIENDLY, AUTOMATIC ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, LOAD) PIPELINE BUILT WITH PYTHON. IT’S DESIGNED TO HELP CLEAN AND PREPARE SPREADSHEET-LIKE DATA—SPECIFICALLY, TABULAR DATA THAT’S OFTEN USED IN MARKETING OR CUSTOMER ANALYSIS. THE SCRIPT USES TWO POPULAR PYTHON LIBRARIES: PANDAS, WHICH IS GREAT FOR HANDLING AND MANIPULATING DATA, AND SCIKIT-LEARN, WHICH PROVIDES TOOLS FOR MORE ADVANCED DATA PREPROCESSING. THE PIPELINE WORKS WITH A SAMPLE DATASET NAMED INPUT_DATA.CSV, WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS THEIR AGE, INCOME, AND PURCHASE AMOUNT (NUMERICAL VALUES), AS WELL AS GENDER AND REGION (CATEGORICAL VALUES). SOME OF THE DATA POINTS ARE MISSING ON PURPOSE, WHICH GIVES THE SCRIPT A CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW IT HANDLES INCOMPLETE DATA DURING THE CLEANING PROCESS. IN THE EXTRACT STEP, THE SCRIPT SIMPLY READS IN THE CSV FILE AND LOADS IT INTO A PANDAS DATAFRAME SO IT CAN BE WORKED WITH EASILY. DURING THE TRANSFORM PHASE, THE SCRIPT DOES ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING TO CLEAN AND PREPARE THE DATA: IT FILLS IN MISSING NUMBERS USING THE MEDIAN OF EACH COLUMN, AND FILLS IN MISSING CATEGORIES USING THE MOST COMMON VALUE (MODE). IT THEN CONVERTS THE CATEGORICAL COLUMNS INTO NUMERIC FORMAT USING ONE-HOT ENCODING, WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO WORK WITH IN LATER STEPS LIKE MACHINE LEARNING. THE SCRIPT ALSO STANDARDIZES THE NUMERICAL COLUMNS SO THEIR SCALES ARE SIMILAR, WHICH HELPS PREVENT SKEWED RESULTS. IN ADDITION TO CLEANING, IT CREATES A NEW FEATURE CALLED THE “AGE-TO-INCOME RATIO,” WHICH CAN GIVE MORE INSIGHT DURING ANALYSIS. THE ENTIRE TRANSFORMATION IS DONE USING SCIKIT-LEARN’S PIPELINE AND COLUMNTRANSFORMER, WHICH MAKE THE PROCESS ORGANIZED, REUSABLE, AND EASY TO FOLLOW. FINALLY, IN THE LOAD STEP, THE CLEANED-UP DATA IS SAVED INTO A NEW FILE CALLED OUTPUT_DATA.CSV. THE ORIGINAL IDS ARE ADDED BACK IN SO YOU CAN STILL TRACE EACH ROW, AND THE SCRIPT PRINTS OUT SOME BASIC STATS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY CHECK IF THINGS LOOK RIGHT. TO RUN THIS PROJECT, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS INSTALL A FEW PACKAGES (PANDAS, SCIKIT-LEARN, AND NUMPY), PLACE YOUR INPUT_DATA.CSV FILE IN THE SAME FOLDER, AND RUN THE SCRIPT WITH PYTHON ETL_PIPELINE.PY. THIS SETUP IS EASY TO EXTEND—YOU COULD SWAP OUT THE CSV FOR A DATABASE, ADD MACHINE LEARNING, OR CONNECT IT TO A DASHBOARD. IT'S PERFECT FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS A SIMPLE BUT SOLID INTRODUCTION TO DATA PIPELINES.
